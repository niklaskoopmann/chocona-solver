# Chocona Puzzle Solver

This piece of Java software solves (or at least tries to solve) Chocona Puzzles (see https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Chocona/index.htm for more info) by using a genetic algorithm. To input a puzzle, you will have to encode it in JSON (see files in /test/input_data/ for the format). Suggestions and a more advanced input parser (e. g. from an image of the puzzle) are more than welcome.
